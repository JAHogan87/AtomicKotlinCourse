## Secondary Constructors (#1)

The starter code contains two data classes `Flower1` and `Flower2`. Both define
only one property `type` of the type `String`. Add a secondary constructor to
the class `Flower1` that takes no arguments and initializes `type` to `Daisy`.
Add a default value `Daisy` to the constructor argument of the `Flower2` class.

The code in `main()` tests that you can now create both classes without
constructor arguments.
