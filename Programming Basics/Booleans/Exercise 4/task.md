## Mastering the IDE: Navigating Backward and Forward

You can easily navigate to a function declared in another file or to a function
in a library. Afterward, it's convenient to navigate back to your original
code.

Navigate backward by pressing <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:Back;</span>.
Navigate forward by pressing <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:Forward;</span>.

You can also choose <span class="control">`Navigate | Back`</span> in the
application menu, and <span class="control">`Navigate | Forward`</span>. You
can navigate to <span class="control">`Last Edit Location`</span> in the same
menu.

Navigate to the `foo()` function definition, then back. Navigate to the
`println()` function definition, then back.
