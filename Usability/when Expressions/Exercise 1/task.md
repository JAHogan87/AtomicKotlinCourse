## `when` Expressions (#1)

Create a function `cloudiness(cloudPercent: Int)` that returns a description
based on the percentage of cloudiness: "Cloudy" (when `cloudPercent` is in the
range 81..100), "Mostly Cloudy" (61..80), "Partly Sunny" (41..60), "Mostly
Sunny" (21..40), and "Sunny" (0..20). If the argument is not in the range
0..100, throw `IllegalArgumentException`.
