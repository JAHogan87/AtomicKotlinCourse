## Sequences (#4)

Implement the `School` extension function `favoriteInstructor()`. It takes
`Student` as a parameter and finds an instructor whose classes this student
takes more often. If there are several such instructors, the first one is
returned. If a student hasn't taken any classes yet, it returns `null`.
