## Objects (#1)

Create a file-level `private fun f()` and `private val p`. The starter code in
`main()` will show you how to write these. Now duplicate `f()` and `p` inside
`object Space` and again in `private object Space2`, and get these to work
according to the code in `main()`. Notice the changes required to make `f()`
available in `main()`. Compare the different approaches.
