## Sequences (#3)

Implement the `School` extension function `averageInstructorRating()` that takes
`Instructor` as a parameter and calculates the average rating that the
instructor was given by all the students that attended his or her classes. If a
student attended several lessons by that instructor, the ratings for individual
lessons should be treated separately.
