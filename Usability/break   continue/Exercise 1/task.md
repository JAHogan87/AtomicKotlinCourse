## `break` & `continue` (#1)

Implement a function `readNumbers()` that takes a `vararg` of `String` as an
argument, and uses a `for` loop to test each `String`. When the input is zero, it
`break`s from the loop and `trace()`s the sum of the entered numbers. If the user
enters a non-number, it `trace()`s "Not a number: $input" and gets the next input
`String`.
