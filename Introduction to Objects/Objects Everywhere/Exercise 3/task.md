## Objects Everywhere (#3)

Building on the previous exercise, strip out special characters before testing.
"Madam I'm Adam" should now be considered a palindrome.

<div class="hint">

Build a new `String` consisting of letters only, and check whether it's
a palindrome. Use `in` to check whether a character is a letter:
`ch in 'a'..'z' || ch in 'A'..'Z'`.

</div>
