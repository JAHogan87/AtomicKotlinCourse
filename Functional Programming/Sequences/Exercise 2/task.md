## Sequences (#2)

Implement the `School` extension functions `studentInstructors()` and
`studentsOf()`. The `studentInstructors()` parameter is a `Student`, and it
finds all instructors that have classes with this student. `studentsOf()` takes
`Instructor` as a parameter and finds all students that attend classes with this
instructor.
