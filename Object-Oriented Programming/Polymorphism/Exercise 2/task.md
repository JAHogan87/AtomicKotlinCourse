## Polymorphism (#2)

The starter code contains class `Frog`, which extends `Animal`. `Animal` defines
two member functions `talk()` and `jump()` that are overridden by `Frog`. All
functions display their information using `trace()`. Note that an `Animal`
always `talk()`s right after it `jump()`s.

`main()` creates a `Frog`, stores it as `Animal`, then calls `jump()`. Your task
is to guess what the output will be.
