## Sequences (#1)

All exercises for this atom use the classes `Instructor`, `Student`, `Lesson`
and `School` defined in `School.kt` in the starter code. These classes model an
online language school that organizes remote lessons for an instructor and a
group of students. Each student can sign up for classes with different
instructors. After a lesson a student can rate that lesson, and these ratings
are stored together with the other information about the lesson.

Define the `School` extension function `commonLessons()` to find all the lessons
that a student is taking with a particular instructor.
