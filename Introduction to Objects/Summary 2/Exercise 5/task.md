## Summary 2 (#5)

Create two functions `va1()` and `va2()`. Each function should take a variable
argument list of `Int`s. `va1()` should display `"va1:"` on the console and
then display its arguments, each on its own line. `va2()` should display
`"va2:"` and then pass its argument list to `va1()`.
