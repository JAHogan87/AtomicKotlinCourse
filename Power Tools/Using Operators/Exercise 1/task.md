## Using Operators (#1)

Create a `data class DataMany` containing `Int` constructor arguments `a`-`j`
with default arguments 1-10. Define a function `all()` that destructures a
`DataMany` and displays the result using `trace`, with each element separated by
a space. Show that `component1()` and `component10()` have been automatically
generated.

Define `firstHalf()` so it destructures and displays the first five elements,
and `secondHalf()` so it does the same for the second five, ignoring the first
five. Define `interspersed()` so that it captures and displays the first element
and every other one, ignoring the elements in between.

The starter code in `main()` tests your work.
